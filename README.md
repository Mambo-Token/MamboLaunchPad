# Mambo Launch Pad
Mambo Launch Pad

Mambo helps to launch KRC-20 tokens according to Mambo's fair launch approach.
That means in most cases it is not a 100% mint token - instead we make an initial widespread token distribution.
The OTC crowdfunding are escorted by Mambo.
The $Yuge advantage of this approach is, that your funds, if you ape into the tokens, directly flow into the token treasury 
and are used for liquidity (DEX, Swaps, CEX) and for floor price protection (buying up dumps).
No need for later crowdfunding for fund for dexes or cexes. No double spending.
No waste of huge amounts of Kas just to create (mint) a token.
Normally we still leave a part for public minting - but not at the best price compared to initial offers.
