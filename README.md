# Mambo Launch Pad
Mambo Launch Pad

Mambo helps to launch KRC-20 tokens according to Mambo's fair launch approach.
That means in most cases it is not a 100% mint token - instead we make an initial widespread token distribution.
The OTC crowdfunding are escorted by Mambo.
The $Yuge advantage of this approach is, that your funds, if you ape into the tokens, directly flow into the token treasury 
and are used for liquidity (DEX, Swaps, CEX) and for floor price protection (buying up dumps).  
No need for later crowdfunding for fund for dexes or cexes. No double spending.  
No waste of huge amounts of Kas just to create (mint) a token.  
Normally we still leave a part for public minting - but not at the best price compared to initial offers.  
As there are now Dex's on Kaspa with permissionless instant listing, 
likw kspr.exchange , kaspafinance.io , zealousswap.com and Kaspa.com .
As long as none of the DEX's have limit orders combined with AMM pools, we rely on native atomic limit order marketplaces like:
https://kaspa.com to sell intial token at a determined price range, this will allow for sophisticated fair launches at different price levels, creating an initial curve.  
Once a Dex will have a mixed AMM/order book swap, things will get even smoother.
It is crucial for soft decentralized trading to abandon the old scool AMM only swaps and get up2date with mixes pools.  
Zilall.com show it already in 2022 how it can be done, even on a Layer 1 smart contract chain.
