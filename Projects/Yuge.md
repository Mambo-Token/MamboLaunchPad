## $Yuge is a unique KRC-20 Memecoin on Kaspa
$Yuge was deployed 2024-10-08, launched Agust 4, 2025.   
No Bullshit, no insane minting costs. No obscure cex listing, no artificial images, no boring top design webpage with some meaningless blabla.  
$Yuge is minimalistic yuge.  
$Yuge is a real Memecoin. After launch the tokens are out of our hands.  
But there is a big difference to 99.9% of other memecoins and tokens.  
The sales funds are directly used for liquidity AND to build up a price support channel, to buy up dumps.  

## Unique and completely fair launch on on [Kaspa.com](https://kaspa.com/?ref=VoKqOIxR) *  

### $Yuge is launched on August 4 2025 on hibit.app, at about 00:15 gtm +2 .

### All tokens (95%) are put on the Marketplace for sale.
The remaining tokens are stored as a reserve for liquidity of future Dex listings.
Everybody has the same chance.
Tokenomics: 1 Million $Yuge. 99.9% premintet.
Only kind of funny people try to mint. It's a joke 0.000001 $Yuge per mint.   
If you have a bad day, then mint some $Yuge, consciously doing something stupid sometimes saves the day.  

# Experience what a really fair and exiting token launch looks like:  
900'000 $Yuge are put as limit orders on hibit.app  
50'000 $Yuge reserved for liquidity.  
Initial offers in the following price levels and tranches:  
As soon as tokens of one period are sold out, next period sales continue, one level down.
The steps down occur every several hours or up to a day.
Period 1: 200k $Yuge at 1.0 Kas  
Period 2: 200K $Yuge at 0.8 Kas  
Period 3: 200k $Yuge at 0.6 Kas  
Period 4: 200K Í„$Yuge at 0.4 Kas  
Period 5: 100K $Yuge at 0.2 Kas  
If tokens are unsold, we continue to lower the price.  
A part of unsold tokens is put to higher price levels.  
A part of unsold tokens maybe burnt.  
Remaining tokens:  
Period 6: at 0.18 Kas  
Period 7: at 0.16 Kas  
Period yx: at 0.0xy
etc.  until all are gone.  
.....  
Funds from sales are directly used to increase the liquidity pool and as buy limit orders at lower levels to support the token.  
Applying the proven Mambo dump protection approach.  
...
That's it.
