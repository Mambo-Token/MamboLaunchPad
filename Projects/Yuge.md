## $Yuge is a unique KRC-20 Memecoin on Kaspa
$Yuge was deployed 2024-10-08, launched Agust 4, 2025.   
No Bullshit, no insane minting costs. No obscure cex listing, no artificial images, no boring top design webpage with some meaningless blabla.  
$Yuge is minimalistic yuge.  
$Yuge is a real Memecoin. After launch the tokens are out of our hands.  
But there is a big difference to 99.9% of other memecoins and tokens.  
The sales funds are directly used for liquidity AND to build up a price support channel, to buy up dumps.  

## Unique and completely fair launch on https://hibit.app Dex

### $Yuge is launched on August 4 2025 on hibit.app, at about 00:15 gtm +2 .

### All tokens (95%) are put on the Dex for sale.
The remaining tokens are stored as a reserve for liquidity of future Dex listings.
Everybody has the same chance.
Tokenomics: 1 Million $Yuge. 99.9% premintet.
Only kind of funny people try to mint. It's a joke 0.000001 $Yuge per mint.   
If you have a bad day, then mint some $Yuge, consciously doing something stupid sometimes saves the day.  

# Experience what a really fair and exiting token launch looks like:  
900'000 $Yuge are put as limit orders on hibit.app  
50'000 $Yuge reserved for liquidity.  
Initial offers in the following price levels and tranches:  
As soon as tokens of one day are sold out, next "day" sales may continue on the same day!  
Attention, a "day" may actually be only some hours, if low demand, we may lower price faster, and if the days allocation is sold out too.  
Day 1: 200k $Yuge at 1.0 Kas  
Day 2: 200K $Yuge at 0.8 Kas  
Day 3: 200k $Yuge at 0.6 Kas  
Day 4: 200K Í„$Yuge at 0.4 Kas  
Day 5: 100K $Yuge at 0.2 Kas  
If tokens are unsold, we continue to lower the price.  
A part of unsold tokens is put to higher price levels.  
A part of unsold tokens maybe burnt.  
Remaining tokens:  
Day 6: at 0.18 Kas  
Day 7: at 0.16 Kas  
etc.  until all are gone.  
.....  
Funds from sales are directly used to increase the liquidity pool and as buy limit orders at lower levels to support the token.  
Applying the proven Mambo dump protection approach.  
...
That's it.
