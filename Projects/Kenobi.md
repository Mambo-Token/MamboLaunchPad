## $Kenobi is a real life Meme created by Elon Musk (no joke) - you can check his X account.

It was created on November 2, 2024, after the cruel gov killed Peanut the famous yt squirrel. (see picture below).

$Kenobi the Squirrel stands for exposing and ending government and burocracy tyranny and cruelties
and bring government criminals into jail forever.
Government has nothing to search in our homes.
If you love Freedom - then buy some $Kenobi and support this memecoin grass root community movement.

## $Kenobi staking!
Stake $Kenobi to get $Rock & $Whales rewards.  
Those rewards are not free tokens, they are bought with the $Kenobi treasury funds.  
The rewards do not inflate the tokens, as they has to be bought, it's a circulation.  

## Roadmap  
- Listing on a real Kaspa DEX.
- Offering rewards for $Kenobi staking.  
- $Kenobi looks for a graphics freak to take the role of the meme godfather (may include Kenobi x account).  
- community building: if needed own x account, own tg group.  
- real life help for suppressed by gov ppl.
- - Website.  

**Decentralization**  
Governments are central forces oftentime abusing there power.  
The primordial main point of the creation of btc or cryptocurrencies and specially of Kaspa is:  

**Decentralization**  
That means $Kenobi's focus is to be on swaps and dexes, once avaiable.  
No funds for Cex listing planned. We need a top Dex - then no need for centralized of private Cex'es.
