## $Kenobi is a real life Meme created by Elon Musk (no joke) - you can check his X account.

It was created on November 2, 2024, after the cruel gov killed Peanut the famous yt squirrel. (see picture below).

$Kenobi the Squirrel stand for exposing and ending government and burocracy tyranny and cruelties
and bring government criminals into jail forever.
Government has nothing to search in our homes.
If you love Freedom - then buy some $Kenobi and support this grass root community movement.
