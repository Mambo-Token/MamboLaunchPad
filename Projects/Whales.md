# $Whales of Kaspa KRC-20
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mambo-Token/MamboLaunchPad/refs/heads/main/logos/Whales-Logo.jpg" width="300" height="300">

## $Whales is a unique native KRC-20 Memecoin on Kaspa - Kasplex protocol.  
### $Whales are very rare. Only 10000 total supply.  
$Whales are the only true OG $Whales ever on Kaspa.  
The ticker $Whales is unique on the Kasplex KRC-20 protocol.  
$Whales are on a real mission to defend the uniqueness of all native KRC-20 Kasplex Coins.
Unlike on Layer 2 EVM, where everybody can create tons of coins with the same ticker,  
the native Layer 1 KRC-20 tokens have an unique ticker, which serves as the address.  
This fact makes them unique and they are the OG's of the Kaspa tokens.  
Only Coins with this kind of unique Ticker are real OG's, no fake copies.  
For this it's important to have bridges between L1 & L2, like the kspr team built.  
This allows to bridge the unique KRC-20 tokens to EVM DEXes.  
### Only Memecoins with a ticker which has direct connection to the original Kasplex protocal are real OG's.  
Nothing can change this fact.  
### To find out if a ticker on a EVM is a unique KRC-20 token, they should have the (KRC-20) mark.  

### This is your occasion to become a whale.  
### Buy $Whales here:  
L1 marketplace. Limit orders. Buy with Kas.  
[https://Kaspa.com](https://kaspa.com/tokens/marketplace/token/WHALES)   
On L2 DEXes:  
[KSPR.Exchange](https://kspr.Exchange)   
Pools: Franc/Whales, Mambo/Whales, Kenobi/Whales.  
You need one of those Solidcoins/Memecoins to buy $Whales!  

## $Whales - Fair launch, no preallocation, no insiders.  
Tokenomics:  
90%, 9000 Tokens are preminted for sales and DEX liqudity.  
1000 Whales are sold on Marketplaces like Kaspa.com with an increasing price ladder.  
900 Whales are liquidity reservers for more DEX listing.
7000 Whales will be put into DEX pools, mostly paired with other Memecoins or solidcoins.  
10%, 1000 $Whales are to be minted. 1 $Whales costs 10000 mints. 1 Mint gives 0.0001 $Whales.  
Wait with minting until the sales price of $Whales on Dexes or marketplaces reaches 10000 Kas! 
The minting price reflects the rarity and the minimum short term price goal.  
The initial sales price is much lower than the mint price, this give investors and speculators a good potential.  
This reflects the price development of this unique memecoin we expect over time.  
We do not exclude to burn eventually unsold tokens at a later point in time, which will make the token even more rare.  
Once outsold, it's out of our control.  
Funds from sales are flowing into $Whales Liquidity and price support Treasury.  
0.99% Whales for token management, team and partners. No other preallocation of hidden deal.  

## Launch: Where and how to buy $Whales?  
$Whales are initially sold on Krsp.Exchange L2 DEX and Kaspa.com L1 Marketplace.  
We may open LP'on other Kaspa Kasplex L2 Dexes too later.  
Marketplace limit orders:  
The sales offers are put on [Kaspa.com](https://kaspa.com/tokens/marketplace/token/WHALES) .    
The starting price is 200 Kas for 1 Whales. Rapidly increasing!  
### The $WHALES price goes up on the price ladder with every $Whales offered.
On [kspr.Exchange](https://kspr.exchange/), $Whales will be in following pools:
$CASH - $Whales   
$KENOBI - $Whales   
$BANANA - $Whales  
$MAMBO - $Whales  
If enough $Kas is built up from sales on Kaspa.com, we may consider to open a Kas-$Whales pool on the DEX too.  
The launch process is fully trustless. You just swap Kas  or Memecoins for $Whales and have it immediatly.  

The funds from the sales are exclusively used to build up liquidity for the token and support reserves to buy up dumps.  
By this approach, $Whales will be very dump restistant, trading up in a price range channel, ideally.  

## Launch Date: about End of August 2025.

## Outlook:  
We will first list on krsp.exchange DEX,  
honoring their important part for the native KRC-20 tokens to create a bridge  
between L1 and L2, so make fake and scam, fraud or pseudo KRC-20 tokens impossible.  
Then we will check on with of the currently 4 other DEXes we will list $Whales too.  
We will not pay for any CEX listing.  
We are making us superfluous over time. $Whales is a OG Degen community token, not ours.  
The fact that there are only 10000 $Whales, makes them very rare.  
$Whales will be included in the $ROCK KRC-20 OG Memecoins Index (ROCKOMI) !
