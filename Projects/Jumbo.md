$Jumbo is a native unique KRC-20 Mamecoin, not some cheap imitations, deployed October 23, 2024.  
$Jumbo stands for: Decentralization, Loyality to Kaspa, Fairness, Simplicity, Fun, Heavy weight.   
$Jumbo will not prostitute to Cex's. If they want, **they** must buy on Dex's, as anybody else has to.   


### You can buy $Jumbo on: 
- [https://kspr.exchange](https://app.kspr.exchange/?ref=MadMax)   
-  [https://kaspa.com](https://kaspa.com/?ref=GUpfDsnN)
-  https://app.zealousswap.com/liquidity

**Total Supply:** 24,000 tokens

It was 100% fair launched:

- 45% (10,800 tokens) for public minting
- 45% (10,500 tokens) initial crowdfund offers placed on 3 different marketplaces at a price scale (see below)
- 10% reserved for liquidity and token price support management

**The earlier you ape into $Jumbo, the more tokens you get. 
The initial offers table, rising prices (progressive less tokens per Kas):**  

| Kas    | Tokens  |
|--------|---------|
| 50 Kas | 325.00  |
| 50 Kas | 320.00  |
| 50 Kas | 315.00  |
| 50 Kas | 310.00  |
| 50 Kas | 305.00  |
| ...    | ...     |
| 50 Kas | 50.00   |

1 Mint = 1 Jumbo
50 mints = 50 Jumbo

## $Jumbo was fastly sold (offers below mint costs) and minted out!**  
But there are still quite a lot initial offers tokens on marketplaces above mint price.  
Funds from those sales will flow into liquidity and rewards or price support buys.  

## DEXes & Marketplaces  
Check between L1 Marketplace prices and Dex prices.  
Low liquidity high volatility can cause short term much higher or lower prices than the limit orders on marketplaces.  
This gives occasion for arbitrage trades between L1 & L2.
