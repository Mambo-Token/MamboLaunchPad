Charlie has the eternal life and not only wrote history on earth,   
but changed history, opening gates of the light of Jesus in this dark world.   
We like to add to immortalize him on earth and inscribe his memorial into the Kaspa blockdag blockchain Layer 1, KRC-20 inscriptions,  
as Kaspa is the fastest and most advance real cryptocurrency technology, having solved the trilemma:  
decentralization, speed, affordable (cheap transactions) for real time p2p payments.  
The uniqueness of the KRC-20 token tickers makes this a very special memorial coin, which cannot be immitated or faked.  

##  $Kirk is a 100% fair open sales and rewards distribution launch.  
No preallocation whatsoever!  
Total supply: 19'932'005  
sales: 300x 25910 $Kirk  = 7'773'000 Tokens.

777 = Jesus Christ multiplies the 300 warriors 10x.  
This is the impact of his martyrdom on earth for the Kingdom of Heaven of Jesus Christ and it's warriors.
