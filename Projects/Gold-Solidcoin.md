$Gold: Probably the most prestige Solidcoin:

The first real digital $GOLD:

$Gold intial price about 1/1000 of 1 ounce of Gold at 2500 USD at 0.17 Kas (September 2024).
= 0.06 $Gold per mint (1 Kas)

1 $Gold = 16.6 Kas

Sales price max 5-25% lower than mint price. There should be more tokens in circulation by sales then by minting, ideally to support the price.
We strongly reccomend **NOT to MINT** but to buy $Gold on Marketplaces or here, to long term support the value of the coins.
The minting price serves as a ceiling, to maintain $Gold in these proportion to Kas.
The future will show whether physical Gold or Kas will perform better , $Gold will follow Kas.
