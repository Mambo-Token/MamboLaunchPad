**$Gold: - the most prestige Solidcoin:**

The first real digital $GOLD:

$Gold intial price about 1/1000 of 1 ounce of Gold at 2500 USD at 0.17 Kas (September 2024).
= 0.06 $Gold per mint (1 Kas)

1 $Gold = 16.6 Kas

The sales price is normally maximum 5-25% lower than the mint price. 

Ideally, there should be more tokens in circulation through sales then by minting to support the price long term.
Funds from sales are used for the $Gold coin community treasury account. 

It can be used for liquidity pools or to support the price by bying up low price offers.

We strongly reccomend **NOT to MINT** $Gold

but to buy $Gold on Marketplaces or here, 

to long term support the value of the coins.


**The minting price serves as a ceiling**, to maintain $Gold in these proportion to Kas.

The future will show whether physical Gold or Kas will perform better , $Gold will follow Kas.

The general solidcoin whitepaper is in preparation, as is the $Gold coin whitepaper.

Those coins aim to teplace completely the need of stablecoins with their problems with anti crypto authorities and regulations.
Solidcoins are not stablecoins, but collectible memecoins held in a certain price range in relation to Kas, the ultimate decentralized cryptocurrency.
Solidcoins makes payment fun, fast, decentralized, easy offer a kine of investment backed partially by Kas (and other solidcoins or mememcoins)
